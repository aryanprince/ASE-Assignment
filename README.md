## ‚ú® Introduction

The Lexical Interpreter Engine is a powerful C# WinForms-based interpreter designed to transform a custom domain-specific language into graphical geometric designs. The interpreter parses and visualizes the commands in real-time, drawing shapes on a canvas based on the lexical tokens provided.

Built to demonstrate concepts of lexical analysis and geometric rendering, it serves as both a functional interpreter and a learning tool for understanding how visualizations can be driven by code.

## üåü Features

- **Lexical Token Parsing**: Translates tokens from a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) into corresponding visual elements.
- **Geometric Rendering**: Draws shapes like triangles, rectangles, squares, and circles on a canvas based on token values.
- **Control Structures**: Supports basic programming constructs such as if, while, and pen for creating dynamic designs.
- **Dynamic Canvas**: Real-time rendering of geometric designs.
- **C# and WinForms**: Built using the powerful .NET framework and WinForms for the UI.
- **GitHub Actions CI Workflows**: Automated CI workflows using GitHub Actions for building and testing.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Language**: C# (.NET Framework)
- **Framework**: WinForms
- **IDE**: Visual Studio
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get up and running with the Lexical Interpreter Engine:

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- .NET Framework 5.0+
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryanprince/Lexical-Interpreter-Engine.git
cd Lexical-Interpreter-Engine
```

2. Open in Visual Studio:

Open the `LexicalEngine.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution:

Build the project using Visual Studio.

4. Run the program:

Execute the project and try out the below test code in the program.

## üé® Test Code for Program

```txt
var x = 50
triangle x
var y = 125
var x = x + 20
rectangle x y
pen 3
if x > 25
  var x = x + 25
  square x
endif
pen 2
while 3
  var y = y + x
  circle y
endwhile
fill 1
pen 1
move x y
triangle y
var x = 250
move x x
rectangle x x
```

## üéØ Roadmap

- **Extended Geometric Shapes**: Add support for additional shapes (polygons, ellipses, etc.).
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Improve lexical error reporting and debugging features.
- **Save/Export Designs**: Allow users to save the rendered designs as image files.
